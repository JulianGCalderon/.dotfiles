# My Dotfiles

Here, my collection of my unix configuration files as packages, managed by `stow`. The `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable should be set to `~/.config`.

To install a given package, run:

```sh
$ stow <package>
```

To uninstall a given package, run:

```sh
$ stow -D <package>
```
