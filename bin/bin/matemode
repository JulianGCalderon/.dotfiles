# A matemode CLI, can be integrated to Helix or Kakoune
# Inspired by mate-mode emacs plugin, by https://github.com/lima-limon-inc
#
# # Usage
#
# Create a new file at ~/.config/matemode/materound. The parent folder can be
# customized with the MATEMODE_PATH env var.
#
# The materound file should contain the round members in order,
# delimited with newline characters.
#
# ```
# Simon
# Santiago
# Andres
# Juan
# ```
#
# Running the script will output the next member in the round,
# updating the materound file.
#
# # Helix Integration
#
# To integrate with helix, add the following configuration:
# ```toml
# [keys.normal.space.m]
# o = [":open ~/.config/matemode/materound", ":write!"]
# m = ":sh matemode"
# ```

: "${MATEMODE_PATH:=$HOME/.config/matemode}"
